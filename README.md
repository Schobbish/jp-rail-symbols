# jp-itinerary-testing

This repo is for testing some things in preparation for creating an itinerary website for a future trip to Japan. My main goal right now is making React components for the various line and station symbols so I can use them in transit directions. I am borrowing some ideas from Wikipedia in that I am using the railway company abbreviations that they use in templates and the HTML/CSS/SVG they use to render them. Of course, I am also using Wikipedia as my main resource for researching these things.

I suppose I'm kinda making this like an NPM module?
